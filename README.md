# Chickadee Tech Active Contributor Discount #
This code powers the Active Contributor Discount which automatically issues discount codes to the Chickadee Tech online store based on one's GitHub activity in a whitelist of repos. The store uses [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/) but can be adapted to any store that supports discount creation through an API.
